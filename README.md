# Image to Sensor CV - Home Assistant Custom Component

A Home Assistant custom component that uses computer vision to analyze images and extract sensor data. Currently supports analog gauge reading with extensible processor architecture.

## IMPORTANT AI note

This component was 95% generated by Copilot, using my prompts and needs.
Structurally its very ugly, code is duplicated in many places.
I'm not familiar with HA, and did that to learn HA programming API and Copilot capabilities.
It works for me however, and can be further improved manually.


## Features

- **Multiple Image Sources**: Support for local image files and Home Assistant camera entities
- **Image Cropping**: Configurable cropping to focus on specific areas of the image
- **Extensible Processors**: Modular architecture for different types of image analysis
- **Analog Gauge Reader**: Built-in processor for reading analog gauge values with or without OpenCV
- **Gauge positioning**: Gauge position is detected smartly. However system still expects image is cropped, so gauge takes 40%-80% of overall image.

## Installation

1. Copy the `image_to_sensor_cv` folder to your `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Configuration > Integrations
4. Click "Add Integration" and search for "Image to Sensor CV"

## Configuration

### Image Source
Choose between:
- **Local Image File**: Path to an image file on the Home Assistant server
- **Home Assistant Camera**: Any camera entity in your Home Assistant instance

### Image Cropping (Optional)
Configure cropping parameters to focus on a specific area:
- **X Position**: Horizontal offset in pixels
- **Y Position**: Vertical offset in pixels
- **Width**: Crop width in pixels
- **Height**: Crop height in pixels

### Analog Gauge Reader Processor
Configure the analog gauge reader with these parameters:

- **Min Angle (Hours)**: The minimum angle of the gauge dial in clock hours (0-12)
  - Example: 7 o'clock position = 7
- **Max Angle (Hours)**: The maximum angle of the gauge dial in clock hours (0-12)
  - Example: 5 o'clock position = 5
- **Min Value**: Minimum reading value of the gauge
- **Max Value**: Maximum reading value of the gauge
- **Units**: Optional unit of measurement (e.g., "psi", "°C", "rpm")

## How the Analog Gauge Reader Works

The analog gauge reader is based on computer vision techniques:

1. **Circle Detection**: Uses Circle edge difference to detect the circular gauge
2. **Needle Detection**: Applies thresholding and line detection to find the needle
3. **Angle Calculation**: Calculates the needle angle relative to the gauge center
4. **Value Mapping**: Maps the angle to the configured value range

### Gauge Requirements

For best results, your analog gauge should:
- Be clearly visible and well-lit
- Have good contrast between needle and background
- Be roughly circular in shape
- Have the needle clearly distinguishable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No circles detected**: 
   - Ensure the gauge is circular and well-lit
   - Try adjusting image cropping to focus on the gauge
   - Check if the image quality is sufficient

2. **No needle detected**:
   - Verify the needle has good contrast against the background
   - Ensure the needle is not too thin or blurry
   - Check that the gauge face is not too cluttered

3. **Incorrect readings**:
   - Verify the min/max angle configuration matches your gauge
   - Check that the min/max value configuration is correct
   - Ensure the needle is the only prominent line in the gauge area

### Debug Information

The sensor provides additional attributes:
- `processor_type`: Type of processor used
- `processor_config`: Current processor configuration
- `last_reading_time`: Timestamp of last successful reading
- `last_error`: Error message if processing failed

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- OpenCV Python (`opencv-python>=4.5.0`)
- NumPy (`numpy>=1.20.0`)
- Pillow (`pillow>=9.0.0`)

### Architecture
The component uses a modular architecture:
- **ImageProcessor**: Handles image acquisition and cropping
- **Processor Classes**: Implement specific analysis algorithms
- **Sensor Entity**: Provides Home Assistant integration
- **Data Coordinator**: Manages periodic updates

## Future Enhancements

Planned processor types:
- Digital display OCR reader
- Object detection and counting
- Color analysis
- Motion detection
- Custom template matching

## Contributing

This component is designed to be extensible. To add new processors:

1. Create a new processor class in `image_processing.py`
2. Implement the `process_image()` method
3. Add configuration options to the config flow
4. Register the processor in the `create_processor()` function
